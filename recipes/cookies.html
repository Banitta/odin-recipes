<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The inspiration for this recipe comes from a desire to find a guilt free dessert that wouldn't raise blood sugar and be keto-ish. The best thing about this recipe is that it is reletively simple, not too sweet, and goes great with black coffee. You have the control with how much sugar or alternative sweetner you choose to add. The go to would be erythritol sweetner like, monkfruit sweetner. However, be warned that there still ongoing studies to test the risks of using these alternative sugars. I find that consuming too much erythritol not only gives a "minty/cooling" taste, but sometimes I get a headache. For that reason, I always go for the less is more approach. Sometimes, I might just forgo the alternative sugar all together and just add 1 tbsp of brown sugar. Again, the choice is up to you!</p>
<p>My favorite kind of peanut butter to use is crunchy, but it is up to you to choose what kind. You can substitute peanut butter for cashew butter, etc. but bear in mind most of the flavor derives from peanut butter. If you want to make the ccokies vegan, simply substitue the 1 egg with a vegan option. This recipe makes about 12 cookies.</p>
